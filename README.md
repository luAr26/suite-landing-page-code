## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("üéâ");
};
```

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn2SKUOaoT4" target="_blank">Learn PostCSS In 15 Minutes</a>

  Main takeaways:

  - [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) is more of a transpiler (like Babel), where you write normal CSS, takes it, modifies it and make it work with older browsers or based on other plugins that you install.

- [Name that color](https://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/#6195ED) - This tool helped me name the colors from the Figma file.

**Note: Delete this note and replace the list above with resources that helped you during the challenge. These could come in handy for anyone viewing your solution or for yourself when you look back on this project in the future.**

## Acknowledgments

This is where you can give a hat tip to anyone who helped you out on this project. Perhaps you worked in a team or got some inspiration from someone else's solution. This is the perfect place to give them some credit.

**Note: Delete this note and edit this section's content as necessary. If you completed this challenge by yourself, feel free to delete this section entirely.**

## Using the Figma design file

Using this design file will help you practice building projects in the same way professionals do. Seeing the details in the design will help you improve your accuracy when building projects and build projects faster.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is an extremely popular design tool that has a generous free tier and can also be used on both Windows and Mac computers.

To get started with Figma, [download the correct app for your operating system](https://www.figma.com/downloads/). You can then open the app and open the `.fig` design file by dragging it over the app and dropping it into the projects home screen.

If you're going to use the Desktop App, you don't need to download the Font Installer from the downloads page. But if you're planning on using the Figma web app you should download and install it to ensure the fonts show up correctly.

If you haven't used Figma before, here are a couple of great resources to get you up to speed:

- [‚ÄúEverything Developers Need To Know About Figma‚Äù article on Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/09/figma-developers-guide/)
- ["Introduction to Figma for Developers" video with Ryan Warner and Jason Lengstorf on Learn with Jason](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/introduction-to-figma-for-developers)

---

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT ‚ö†Ô∏è: Please be sure not to share our design files with anyone else. We include `.gitignore` files in the starter code download to help prevent you from accidentally uploading it to GitHub. Another easy way to prevent this is to keep the design file separate from your codebase.**
